Map of historical and environmental sites on the Cahaba River in Alabama. 

I am going to try and use Mapbox to make a slippy map that highlights this very long river running from central Alabama, through the Cahaba National Wildlife Refuge, and down through Selma, the center of the Civil Rights Movement and Alabama's first state capital. I'm looking now at data from the US Forest Service for rivers. 

I previously planned to map reported kudzu infestations in Alabama, but once I got into the data, I realized that almost every report was by one very vigilant Cooperative Extension Agent in south Alabama. :)
